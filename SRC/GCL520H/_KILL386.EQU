; NOTES
;
; This file contains the definitions that 32 bit protected mode assembly
; language should use to access the _asi_kill_time function.  Mostly,
; this is done via the KILL_TIME macro.
;
; MODIFICATIONS
;
;  December 1, 1994   5.10A :  Initial release.

;
; You will note that I have an ifdef that prevents this definition from
; being assembled when I am inside KILL386.ASM.  This prevents a clash
; between the EXTRN declaraction here and the PUBLIC definition in
; KILL386.ASM.
